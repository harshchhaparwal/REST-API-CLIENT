DESCRIPTION: 

Weather Fetcher – Java API Consumer
Overview: The Weather Fetcher is a simple Java-based application that consumes real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It makes an HTTP GET request to fetch the latest weather information for a given city, processes the received JSON response, and displays it in a structured format in the console.

Key Features:
✅ REST API Consumption – Fetches weather data using OpenWeatherMap API.
✅ JSON Parsing – Extracts relevant weather details such as temperature, humidity, and description.
✅ Error Handling – Handles HTTP response errors and invalid API keys.
✅ Structured Output – Displays formatted weather details in the console.

How It Works:
1. The program sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API using Java’s HttpURLConnection.
2. It receives a JSON response, which includes weather details such as temperature, humidity, and conditions.
3. The JSON response is parsed using the org.json.JSONObject library.
4. The extracted weather data is displayed in a clear, formatted output.

Technologies Used:
Java (Core Java, Exception Handling, HTTP Requests)
OpenWeatherMap API (Public REST API for weather data)
JSON Processing (org.json library for parsing JSON)
